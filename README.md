# Capstone Project

Master's Data Science Capstone project.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <agent-evidence>
cd <agent-evidence>
```

### 2. Install Conda

This project uses Conda to manage the Python environment and dependencies.

If Conda is not already installed, install either **Miniconda** or **Anaconda** before continuing.

### 3. Create the Environment

The project's dependencies are defined in `environment.yml`.

From the root directory of the repository, run:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

This will create the `capstone` environment with the appropriate Python version and project dependencies.

### 4. Activate the Environment

```bash
conda activate capstone
```

Verify that the environment is using Python 3.11:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see:

```text
Python 3.11.x
```

### Updating the Environment

If `environment.yml` changes after you have already created the environment, update your local environment with:

```bash
conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
```

This installs new dependencies and removes dependencies that are no longer specified in the environment file.

## Project Structure

```text
.
├── environment.yml       # Conda environment and dependencies
├── README.md             # Project documentation
├── data/                 # Project datasets
├── notebookc/            # Exploratory analysis and experiments
├── Code/src                  # Source code
└── results/              # Experimental outputs and results
```

The project structure may change as development progresses.

## Development

When adding a new dependency, add it to `environment.yml` so that all team members use a consistent environment.

After modifying `environment.yml`, update your environment:

```bash
conda env update -f environment.yml --prune
```
